# 🎯 START HERE - Ernakulam Air Quality Monitor

## Your Application is Ready! 🎉

I've simplified your NASA air quality application to focus **specifically on Ernakulam District, Kerala**.

---

## 🚀 Run It Now (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Open Terminal
Navigate to the NASA folder:
```bash
cd /Users/apple/Downloads/NASA
```

### Step 2: Start the Server
Run the startup script:
```bash
./start-ernakulam.sh
```

**OR** start manually:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements-simple.txt
python main.py
```

### Step 3: View the Dashboard
Open `dashboard.html` in your browser:
```bash
open dashboard.html
```

**OR** visit the API documentation:
```
http://localhost:8000/docs

### Using cURL:
```bash
# Get district summary
curl http://localhost:8000/api/summary

# Get all stations
curl http://localhost:8000/api/stations

# Get Kochi City data
curl http://localhost:8000/api/stations/EKM001

# Get 24-hour history
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/stations/EKM001/history?hours=24"

# Get 48-hour forecast
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/stations/EKM001/forecast?hours=48"
```

## 💡 What's Different?

### Before:
- ❌ Complex setup with database, Redis, Celery
- ❌ Multiple external APIs (NASA, AirNow, NOAA)
- ❌ Machine learning models
- ❌ Difficult to run

### After:
- ✅ Simple FastAPI application
- ✅ No database needed
- ✅ Mock data with realistic patterns
- ✅ Run with one command
- ✅ Focused on Ernakulam district only

```

### Dashboard shows error?
- Make sure the server is running first
- Check if you can access http://localhost:8000
- Open browser console (F12) for details

### Port 8000 already in use?
Edit `backend/main.py` and change the port:
```python
uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8001, reload=True)
```
